Security Vulnerability with SQL Injection,"SQL Injection is a technique to maliciously exploit applications that use client-supplied data in SQL statements. Generally, the attackers trick the SQL engine into executing unintended commands by supplying specially crafted string input, thereby gaining unauthorized access to a database in order to view or manipulate restricted data.

Too formal ? Lets keep it normal.

SQL injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to destroy your database. From the #Yahoo Attack to the latest #Starbucks accounting database hack, the SQL injection attacks represent upto two-thirds of all webapp attacks.

Initially, to understand the vulnerability to SQL Injection attacks, one must be aware of those applications that are vulnerable. And this can be tested only when we launch attacks on our own applications to test the #effectiveness. Correct !!

So, during our latest Flash talk, Aman and Rishabh being our Captains, we’ve discussed on those applications and the prevention techniques. Talking on the topic the duo also spoke on “Havij” an automated SQL Injection attack tool used by penetration testers to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities, making the session very knowledgeable.",Aman Prakash and Rishabh Nair,Feb 2020
NFV - MANO,"“Acceleration of change” is one of the prime characteristics of the #DigitalRevolution and NFV is one of those technologies that is revolutionizing networks worldwide.

NFV- Management and Orchestration, also called MANO, is an architectural framework for managing and orchestrating virtualized network functions and other software components which consists of the Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM), VNF Manager (VNFM) and the NFV Orchestrator (NFVO). In simpler words MANO is what which is needed to reign in the Cloud and to create innovative services at a click of a button for the associated VNF's .

The demand for the expertise in MANO is growing exponentially with more and more payloads moving into the cloud.

When provided a platform to share his bright understanding on NFV-MANO, Siddharth Rai, our Tech Architect has just nailed it explaining it in a simpler way. Sid is an expert working on a #VPP (Vector Packet Processing) and DPDK based technologies in #IOT and 5G spsace. He also has rich experience in development and maintenance on telecom and cloud/virtualization based projects.",Siddarth Rai,Jan 2020
Scalability and Elasticity in CloudComputing,"Scalability reflects to the ability of any system to handle increased load. Well, to keep it simple, a system is said to be scalable if the user experience is uniform whether there are hundreds or thousands or millions of users on the application.

“Designing for scalability” is critical to build any application suitable to serve millions of users. Elasticity is the new paradigm for cloud applications to efficiently scale out and scale in as the load varies. Scalingdesignpatterns when implemented accurately can address huge traffic with just-in-time usage of cloud resources. Our latest Flashtalk delivered by our young MIND Rishabh Nair is all about those techniques of “Scalability and elasticity”

Having explained about horizontal and #vertical scaling, Nair spoke about tackling challenges in implementing Monolithic and Microservices architecture. Talking about the loadbalancer which distributes work to a number of servers, he also explained about databasecaching, clustering & sharding. The interactive and lively session was not only informative but also engaging.",Rishabh Nair,Jan 2020
Understanding DevOps,"DevOps - the culture that promotes collaboration between Development and Operations, is said to enable and drive adoption of cloud-centric technologies as it matures. To keep it simple “DevOps maturity will fuel continued interest in cloudcentric tools” As driving automation being one of the most powerful areas of impact for DevOps, we had a session on the same as our Friday ritual. We Truminds call it a flash talk. It is our Young MIND AnshulWalia supported by the our tech genius Chetan Kabu, the pilots this week who took us on a journey in to the world of DevOps. Having delivered an engaging talk Anshul summarized it as “DevOps accomplishes several things as to increasing the velocity of the development pipeline, reducing the number of errors in code and often freeing up time for developers, allowing them to focus more on hashtag#creatingvalue and less on repeatable and mundane tasks”. One of the most relevant topics delivered by the awesome duo made it an interesting session.",Anshul Walia,Dec 2019
5G,"5G is all set to change the way the world functions. It would kindle and drive the hashtag#innovation of new genres of products and services leading to smarter industries, cities and lives. The latest advanced wirelesstechnology is all set to generate new revenue streams for industries across various sectors, while also having an impact of existing businesses too. With 5G coming on its swag to transform businesses, Vikas Chuchra, our Solution Architect, who has more than 16 years of experience in diverse domains specifically in telecom industry, has delivered a well-framed flash talk on 5G. Vikas is an expert in LTE,  IoT, AzureCloud and 5GCore. Elaborating on mmWaves, Small-cells, Massive MIMO and beamforming he has phrased them to be the factors leading to huge improvement in throughput as compared to LTE. Having discussed about the revolutionary changes that 5G core has undergone to align itself, he inferred that SBA, statelessness and network slicing are some of the hashtag#keydrivers in this change. A deep dive into the world of 5G, the session was more than just an introduction. These knowledge sharing sessions on any emerging and uttingedgetechnologies makes our day energetic and insightful.",Vikas Chuchra,Nov 2019
